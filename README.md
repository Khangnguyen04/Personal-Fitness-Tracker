# Personal-Fitness-Tracker

A fully functional Tableau dashboard that tracks insights on my workouts since the beginning of 2023.

## Data Collection 

I keep all of my information on my workouts within the notes app of my iPhone and collected info on these categories:

* Calories burned
* Duration of workout
* Date of workout
* Type of workout
* Intensity level

I then moved this information into an Excel file that can be downloaded in another file in this repo

## Explore data in Tableau

After my data is imported into Tableau, I can create my visualizations. The visualizations provided are:

* Calories burned per workout
* Duration of workout
* Intensity level and average calories burned
* Monthly summary of progress

There is also a calendar filter that shows you information on each day I worked out! Alongside it is a duration slider, and calories burned slider.

## Final Thoughts

I will be updating it at the beginning of each month to see the trends at the end of the year!
